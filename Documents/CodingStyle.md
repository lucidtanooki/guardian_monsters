# Coding Style Guide

## File Head

Every Source Code File should contain a head in the following structure

```java
/**
 *
 * @author Georg Eckert 2017
 *
 */
```

## Maximum Line Width

Standard line width should be 100 characters.

## Visual Structure

Code Sections (Attributes, Constrcutors, Methods a.s.o.) should be seperated by
a comment. This comment should look like this:

```java
// ............................................................................ ATTRIBUTES
```

The important part is, that the dots (...) go to the 100th character.


## Comments

Every method, if it is public and not a getter, a setter or too simple, should
have a proper JavaDoc.
