Hi there,
I am a student developing my first RPG and I plan to release it for android one day (so it's a commercial project). May I use your awesome RPG music set on OpenGameArt "The Last Encounter Collection" and the "Lively Meadow Victory Fanfare"?

Hope to hear from you soon. Keep up the great work!

Cheers,
Georg
