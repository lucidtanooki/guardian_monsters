# Monsters and Humans

When youngsters turn 16, the gods send them four guardians to choose from.
The youngster has to climb a mountain and find a crystal to ban it. To ban
guardians, a crystal is always needed. As soon as the guardian got banned,
the youngster has to bound it to one of his seven chakras. Guardians can
switch between the normal world and the parallel world any time. To change
the bound guardian, humans have to visit portals, where the parallel worlds
get in contact. There, every monster, they ever banned, can be called easily
and bound to a chakra.

Monsters can carry items like helmets, swords and other stuff.

When battlink, monsters get EXP and reach new levels. Reaching new levels raise
their base values. Additionally they earn SXP - skill experience. SXP can be 
used to unlock new attacks in the skill tree.

Only seven attacks can be used in a battle. outside of battles, these 7 attacks
can be changed any time.
