Story
=====

Once, their only was the *singularity*. Event time did not exist then. When the
singularity got unstable, it split up in four, and the four gods where born.
Gaia - the Goddess of Earth, Luna - the Goddess of Water Accendos - God of Fire
and Aetherius - God of the Air.

The four of them created mankind. Gaia and Accendos created the first woman and
Luna and Aetherius the first man. For the first ten thousand years men worshipped
their divine parents and the gods gave them the four elements, so they could
live in prosperty. But some men strived for power and tried to gain the elements
for their own advantage. Other men followed them and then there where ten thousand
years of war. The so called Element Wars. 

In their strive for might, people forgot about about their divine parents and
did no longer pray to them. The gods where disappointed by the hatred and
violence they saw and turned their back on man.

Men used the elements as waepons in the battle. When they collided, new elements
emerged. From the clash of Earth and Water Forests arose. In the violent vortex
of Fire and Air Spirits came into existance. Water and Air rose Ice and where 
Earth and Fire collided, Darkness spread. In the clash of Earth, Fire and Darkness
Lindworms came to life. Fire, Air and Spirit caused Lightning. Where Water, Air
and Ice came in contact, mountains grew. Form the Forests Insects emerged.

Since then, their have been no new elements. Today our world consists of the
twelve of them. Legend has it, that, when the big four one day collide, the gods
and all elements will return into Singularity and the existence of everything
will end in Ragnarök.

Their is a relic for every element. Who gains a relic, controls an element and
everything that consists of it. To stop the wars, twelve wise men and women
protected them with strong spells and mighty beasts and since then they have not
been gained by any human being.
