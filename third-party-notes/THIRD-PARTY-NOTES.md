# Additional requirements

## Music by Matthew Pablo

Matthew Pablo has some additional rules on how to attribute his work. From website (https://matthewpablo.com/services/):

>"Games and Interactive Media:
>Not all these credits are required, but it should be discussed with me as to which credits will be provided. Usually a credit on the credits screen and a credit in the description on the app store are my standard requirements. If you are providing any other types of credits for me this is how they should be formatted:
>
>Front-end credits:
>Music by Matthew Pablo
>http://www.matthewpablo.com
>
>Main title screen (if you wish to put any credits there you should also include mine as well, if you aren't putting any credits, then you don't need to)
>Featuring Music by Matthew Pablo
>http://www.matthewpablo.com
>
>Ending credits:
>Music by Matthew Pablo
>http://www.matthewpablo.com
>
>Lastly, if you are publishing to an online app store or anything similar, please make sure I am credited in the description there as well:Featuring Music by Matthew Pablo
>http://www.matthewpablo.com"
